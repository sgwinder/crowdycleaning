# crowdycleaning
small repo for crowdy cleaning scripts

On April 9, 2020, copied this script into the crowdy repo on the dumbparsing branch.
Consider this repo closed.

Creating this to track ongoing efforts to munge the clean crowdy data created by Grace into parking lot counts.
I expect this script will be incorporated into the bigger on-site data workflow
